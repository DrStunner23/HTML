<!-- In order to use the website we've created we need to host it. There are many free
  website hosting servers available, like godaddy and bluehost (but most of them are
  paid services, because we need to pay for the server space).

  While learning, we can use the 'github.com' service. But in 'github.com' it is used
  for several purposes, but we are now only using it for hosting purpose.
  New repository > enter the Repository name > check the box 'Add a readme file' >
  create the repository.

  Add file > upload a file > select and add all the files which is required for
  the project (Even the images folder).

  Under the settings > pages > under source > select the source 'main' (as the branch) >
  save (so github will now publish with our username.github.io/filename/)

  Since it is a https website, we can access it from anywhere from the world. as long as
  we have the internet.

  What is a repository?
  It is just a folder in the cloud, which will store all the project related files.
  which allows to make the changes and update the files and also it helps in tracking
  the changes that occur in the file.
  Remember to always check the box of 'Add a Readme file'
